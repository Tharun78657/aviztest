  <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
  <p>This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or seek a refund for a service (courses we offer) that you have purchased through the Platform. Under this policy:

Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within 1 day of placing the order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the course access has already been granted or the enrollment process has been completed.

DIGITAL WIN TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED does not accept cancellation requests for services that are time-bound, personalized, or have already been consumed (partially or fully). However, a refund or replacement may be considered if the user establishes that the quality of the service delivered is not satisfactory.

In case of any issues with the service such as technical problems or access-related concerns, please report them to our customer service team. The request will be entertained once the service provider listed on the Platform has reviewed and verified the concern. This should be reported within 1 day of service activation or access.

If you feel that the service received is not as described or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within 1 day of activation. The customer service team, after reviewing your complaint, will take an appropriate decision.

In case of complaints regarding services provided by third-party platforms or partners, please refer the issue to them directly as per their warranty or support policy.

In case of any refunds approved by DIGITAL WIN TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED, Refunds will be credited to the original payment method within 7-10 working days.
